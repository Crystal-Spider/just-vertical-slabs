# Just Vertical Slabs
### Finally build with Vertical Slabs in Vanilla or with any mod you've installed!

## Features
- **Works out of the box with any mod!**
- Vertical Slab variants for any block with slab variants, Vanilla or not!
- Vertical Slabs combine like stairs do!
- Vertical Slabs craftings! See next section for more details.
- Creative Tab with all available Vertical Slabs!

***Important note:***  
*All and only blocks that already have slab variants will also get vertical slab variants, this to keep a Vanilla-like game style that nicely adapts to any eventual mod.  
If you want more vertical slabs it's sufficient to add more slabs. Then, automatically, vertical slabs will be added to the game.*

## Craftings
- 3 of the same block in a column to craft a vertical slab.
- 2 of the same vertical slab in a row to craft a full block.
- 2 of the same slab in a column to craft a full block.
- Vertical slabs can be crafted into slabs and vice versa just by putting them alone in the crafting.
- Waxing works as usual, both in-world and in-crafting.
- Stonecutter recipes are available.  
  It must be noted that, due to some implementation restrictions, a block can be stonecut only in its main vertical slab. To obtain the other vertical slab veriants of that block the crafting recipes above must be used.
