# Just Vertical Slabs
### Finally build with Vertical Slabs in Vanilla or with any mod you've installed!

## Features
- **Works out of the box with any mod!**
- Vertical Slab variants for any block with slab variants, Vanilla or not!
- Vertical Slabs combine like stairs do!
- Vertical Slabs craftings! See next section for more details.
- Creative Tab with all available Vertical Slabs!

See some screenshots [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-vertical-slabs/screenshots)!

***Important note:***  
*All and only blocks that already have slab variants will also get vertical slab variants, this to keep a Vanilla-like game style that nicely adapts to any eventual mod.  
If you want more vertical slabs it's sufficient to add more slabs. Then, automatically, vertical slabs will be added to the game.*

## Craftings
- 3 of the same block in a column to craft a vertical slab.
- 2 of the same vertical slab in a row to craft a full block.
- 2 of the same slab in a column to craft a full block.
- Vertical slabs can be crafted into slabs and vice versa just by putting them alone in the crafting.
- Waxing works as usual, both in-world and in-crafting.
- Stonecutter recipes are available.  
  It must be noted that, due to some implementation restrictions, a block can be stonecut only in its main vertical slab. To obtain the other vertical slab variants of that block the crafting recipes above must be used.

## Credits
A very big thank you goes to the Forge team that allowed anyone to mod Minecraft for free and their support in the Forge Forums.  
In particular I want to thank diesieben07 that followed me throughout most of the development, without him none of this would have been possible.

## Technical details
This mod is required on both server and client to work.  
For slab items to be recognized as slabs they must have the *minecraft:slabs* tag, as they should. If they don't, there's no way to understand whether they are slabs or not, so they are assumed to be not.  
If another mod adds slabs that are not recognized by this mod, it's most probably for this reason, so check it and ask the other mod author to fix that.

## Mod Improvement
**Help wanted!**  
There are a few points this mod is lacking in and I'd like to improve it, however I don't have nearly enough time nor energy to do so.  
For this reason I'm looking for someone that would be available to help improve this project (for free of course).  
If you think you are interested in becoming a co-author, help improve this mod and expand its ecosystem, please contact me with a message on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/private-messages/send?recipient=crystal_spider_).
