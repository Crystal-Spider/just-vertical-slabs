## **Description**
Minecraft has always been lacking something important: vertical slabs.  
Because of this most mods adding new slabs do not include vertical slabs and you'd have to download addon mods to add them, in the rare case they even exist.  
This mod aims to fix all of the above, adding vertical slabs dynamically for Vanilla and each mod installed!  

See some screenshots [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-vertical-slabs/screenshots)!

***Important note:***  
*All and only blocks that already have slab variants will also get vertical slab variants, this to keep a Vanilla-like game style that nicely adapts to any eventual mod.*  
*If you want more vertical slabs it's sufficient to add more slabs. Then, automatically, vertical slabs will be added to the game.*

## **Features**
- **Works out of the box with any mod!**  
- Vertical Slab variants for any block with slab variants, Vanilla or not!  
![Variants](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyphet/mod-fancy-assets/main/just-vertical-slabs/variants.png)  
- Vertical Slabs combine like stairs do!

## **Craftings**
- 3 of the same block in a column to craft a vertical slab.  
![Full to vertical](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyphet/mod-fancy-assets/main/just-vertical-slabs/full-to-vertical.png)  
- 2 of the same vertical slab in a row to craft a full block.

![Horizontal to full](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyphet/mod-fancy-assets/main/just-vertical-slabs/horizontal-to-full.png)  
- Vertical slabs can be crafted into slabs and vice versa just by putting them alone in the crafting.

- Waxing works as usual, both in-world and in-crafting.

- Stonecutter recipes are available.

It must be noted that, due to some implementation restrictions, a block can be stonecut only in its main vertical slab. To obtain the other vertical slab variants of that block the crafting recipes above must be used.

## **Credits**
A very big thank you goes to the Forge team that allowed anyone to mod Minecraft for free and their support in the Forge Forums.  
In particular I want to thank *diesieben07* that followed me throughout most of the initial development.

## **License and right of use**
Feel free to use this mod for any modpack or video, just be sure to give credit and possibly link [here](https://github.com/Nyphet/just-vertical-slabs#readme).

## **For developers**
For slab items to be recognized as slabs they must have the *minecraft:slabs* tag, as they should. If they don't, there's no way to understand whether they are slabs or not, so they are assumed to be not.  
If another mod adds slabs that are not recognized by this mod, it's most probably for this reason, so check it and ask the other mod author to fix that.
